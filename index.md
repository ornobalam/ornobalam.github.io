Hi! I am a graduate student working in Michael Puruggananâ€™s lab at New York University. I study the evolutionary and demographic history of domesticated Asian rice.  

My biggest interest outside of scientific research is in communicating scientific research to a wider audience. This website links to my blog which I started early on 
during my PhD to chronicle my experiences as I progressed through the program and write the occasional science communication.
