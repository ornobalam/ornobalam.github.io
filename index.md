I am a PhD student studying the adaptive and demographic history of domesticated Asian rice in Michael Puruggananâ€™s lab at New York University. My scientific interests beyond my own field of research include animal domestication, human population genetics and evolution, and evolutionary conflicts between hosts and pathogens. I am currently also working as a Scientific Writer at the international centre for diarrhoeal disease control, Bangladesh (icddr,b).
  
In the past, I have conducted research on hormonal modulation of antiviral responses, health service delivery in slums in Bangladesh, and the social impact of the 1947 Partition of British India.
